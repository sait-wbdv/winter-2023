		- CPNT 264: Career and Consulting Essentials
				- Dasa will email you with details
		- CPLN 240: Guest Speaker Day
				- SAIT admin will send you details?
2. Lunch from 11:30am - 12:30pm
		- There will also be multiple breaks throughout the day.
3. There will be opportunities to earn late starts and early dismissals! Ask your instructors for details.

## One-on-ones with Instructors
Direct Message (DM) an Instructor/Facilitator anytime if you have a private **non-coding** concern or question.

But, for **coding help**, it's encouraged you (in this order):
1. Spend an honest amount of effort toward solving the problem yourself;
2. Post your question for help in the `#fall-2022` channel on Slack;
3. Ask your instructor/classmate during Open Lab time (most afternoons).
