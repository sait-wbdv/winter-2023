## Scenario
A local print shop is offering a free promotion for QR Code stickers that people can scan on their phones. You realize you can use them for a web page you would like to build.

Choose a web page project that you can use for these QR Codes. For example:
- Place a QR Code on your business cards that lead to your portfolio website.
- Create an online menu for a local restaurant for customers to scan when they sit at their tables.
- Create a website for your music band shows. You can put the stickers on show posters you put up on 17th Avenue.

Your website concept should be a simple one-page website that you can build in class.

### Instructions: Reflection and Learning
Submit the following as comment to this Achievement:
- A title and one sentence summary of the website you'd like to build;
- Who is the website for? You? A hypothetical client? A family member?
- Where would you place the QR codes? In what scenario would a user scan them to view your website?

### Proof of Work
Using an online QR code generator, create a QR code that directs a user to a GitHub pages URL on your account. Note, you do not have to build out your web page. You just want to test that the QR code works.
