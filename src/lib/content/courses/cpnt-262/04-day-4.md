## 1. Strings and string methods
[![Slides - Javascript strings](/images/slides/js-strings.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-strings.html)

### Activity: String method practice
In pairs, practice using string methods:
1. Go to wikipedia and choose a sentence or phrase that interests you (or doesn't);
2. In a new `client.js` file, create a `string` variable containing your selected phrase;
3. Try using the following string methods on your phrase:
    - Using `String.length`, log the sentence "This phrase has [Number] characters", replacing `[Nunber]` with the actual number of characters in the `string`.
    - Using `String.startsWith()`, log a `true` or `false` based on whether or not the the word "The" (or similar) matches the start of the `string`.
    - Using `String.endsWith()`, log whether or not the `string` is a question.
    - Using `String.includes()`, log a `true` or `false` based on whether or not the `string` contains the word "the" (or similar).
    - Using `String.indexOf()`, log the `index` of the first matching word (i.e. "the") found in the `string`.
    - Add the `<textarea>` counter back into the starter form.
    - Using `String.split()`, log each character in the `string` as an array.

### Activity: DOM practice
In pairs:
1. Using `document.querySelector()` and `Element.innerHTML`, try printing the console logs you created in the previous activity to a `<p>` element on an HTML page;
2. Using `prompt()` print dynamic content to an HTML page using user input.
