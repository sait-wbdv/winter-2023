## Event Listeners Follow Up

- [v-on](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-on) for handling events and functions (use this for things like your hamburger menu)

## Event Handling

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling.html)
- [v-on gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/74543137780c1958f01e9b470a3cb13b) with notes on how to use `v-on`
- `v-on` is used to listen to DOM events and trigger a javascript handler (often a function)
- syntax: `v-on:click="handler"`
  - or shortened as`@click="handler`
- Use this for any buttons on a page
  - set the handler to be a function
- This can be used with the [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) to make variables more reactive

### Event Modifiers

- To stop a form from being submitted when using a `<button>`, or to stop other default behaviour, use `.prevent`
  - `@click.prevent="myFunction`
  - Check out the other event modifiers
    - `@click.once` - will only trigger once
    - `@click.passive` - great for touch events
  - Key modifiers allow for effecting how an event handler is triggered
  - You can specify specific keys using key aliases and key modifiers

#### Creating Switches

- To make reactive switches, you'll want to use the following syntax
- `let variable = reactive({val: false})`
  - this will make a reactive variable that response to v-on well
- `const variableSwitch = () => variable.val = !variable.val`
  - this will create a switch that changes the variable to false
- `<button @click.prevent="variableSwitch">Click me</button>`
  - note that this doesn't need to be a button

### Activity: Make a toggle

- Create a toggle for the v-if that we made in the last activity
- Add a `@click.prevent` directive to a button
- Make the event switch the boolean variable between true and false
  - `variable = !variable`
- See your content change!

## Reactive Variables in Vue 3

- [Reactivity Fundamentals](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html)
- syntax:
  - `ref()`: 'Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property .value that points to the inner value.'
  - `reactive()`: 'Returns an active proxy of the object'
- What they do:
  - Make vue track changes to the variables and re-evaluate dependent variables etc
- Differences:
  - ref() is for strings, numbers, booleans and objects
    - reactive() is for objects
  - ref() uses `.value` to access the properties
    - reactive does not
- [When to choose each](https://medium.com/@bsalwiczek/ref-vs-reactive-in-vue-3-whats-the-right-choice-7c6f7265ce39)
  - **for most cases you should use `ref()`**
  - `reactive()` is great for when you need to use map
- Storage past refresh?
  - for longer term storage, you would use a store like [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

### Activity: Create a reactive toggle

- Set a ref() variable up as a Boolean toggle
- Add a v-on event to the page to change the Boolean value
- Use `v-show` with your toggle to hide/show content
