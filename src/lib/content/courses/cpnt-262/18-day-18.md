Intro to Nuxt

- Nuxt 3 is a frontend framework built around VueJS
  - It uses vue syntax but bundles a lot of features
    - [Filesystem Routing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing)
    - [Auto Imported Components](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports)
    - [Static Generation, Server Side Rendered, Single Page Application](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#static-hosting)
    - [Modules to Extend Functionality](https://nuxt.com/modules)
    - It has the [nitro h3 microserver](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/server#server) built into it, so you can set up routing like you would with [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- All Vue syntax is valid in Nuxt
  - However it's built around and optimized for Vue 3 and composition api syntax
- Nuxt 3 is designed to be a 1 stop solution for web pages and applications
- It is also easy to deploy to services like Netlify, Vercel, or Github Pages
- [Video: What is Nuxt?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBdO5myZNsQ&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9haQlqdCQyYmL_27TesCGPC&index=1) -- this is the first video in the series linked in the next section.

## Nuxt Setup

- [Follow Project Setup Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation)
- Create a new project using this command: `npx nuxi init nuxt-app` (replace nuxt-app with the name of your app/site)
- Navigate to the new project directory and run `npm install`
- You're good to go! spin up a dev server with `npm run dev`

### File Structure Essentials

- `nuxt.config.ts`: add modules and set global defaults and settings here.
- `app.vue`: this is the main entrypoint to your page. It creates the default layout that your pages are injected into (you can move this file and rename it to `layouts/default.vue` in order to create other layouts if needed)
- `pages/`: create your web pages here (just like `views/` in a Vue app). They will be auto imported without any extra setup
- `components/`: add components here, they will also auto import and be available anywhere in your app

### Activity: Create a new page

- add a new page to your `pages/` directory
- use lowercase naming conventions (unlike vanilla vue)
- Set up a vue single file component and render a some text
- Create a link to the page using the following syntax on your `pages/index.vue` page:
  - `<NuxtLink to=/page-name">Page Name</NuxtLink>`
- Navigate to the page in a dev server

## Adding Modules

- [Google Fonts Module](https://nuxt.com/modules/google-fonts)
- [Tailwind Module](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss)
- [Lodash](https://nuxt.com/modules/lodash)
- [Strapi](https://nuxt.com/modules/strapi)

### Activity: Add Tailwind following the documentation linked above

- Install the module
- Add it to the nuxt config file
- Test out some utility classes

## Let's Create Components!

- Just like in vue, create your components in your components directory, but now you don't need to import them individually!

### Demonstration/Activity

- Recreate the [3 card layout on Smashing Magazine's Homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)
- Topics
  - Reusable Custom Card Component
  - List Rendering with v-for
  - `<NuxtLink>` built in component
  - Tailwind for quick styling

#### Breakouts Activities

_We will pause throughout building for people to follow along with these tasks_

1. Set up your card component
   - Create a `components/AppCard.vue` file and add minimal content
   - Add the card to your `pages/index.vue` page
   - Make sure you can see it using the dev server
2. Create Props and Add Default Placeholder Content
   - Content Props (text)
   - Set up html to render default values
3. Add your Card Data to the `index.vue` page
   - Create an array of 3 objects
   - Add these keys + values for each:
     - title
     - description
     - buttonUrl
     - buttonText
   - **These should match your props**
4. Loop through and render your cards
   - `v-for` loop
   - `v-bind` prop values
5. Add Color Props and Class Bindings
   - Add a color and bgColor prop in the component
   - Set up class bindings on the relevant tags
   - Add the values to each card (green, orange, purple)
   - Bind the colors to the component on the `index.vue` page
