## 1. Forms and Javascript
[![Slides - Forms and Javascript](/images/slides/js-forms.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/f22/cpnt-262/js-forms.html)

### Demo: Adding Machine
- [Sample code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f22/tree/main/2022-10-25-forms/01-form-starter)

### Activity: Creating forms
In groups of 2-3:
- Pick one of the functions included in [this Activity](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/64c3c63e0ee7de3aa56adfc99deeeef8);
- Follow the provided instructions to:
    - In the HTML:
        1. Create a `<form>` element that contains the required fields for the user to enter the function inputs;
        2. Create a `<p>` that will store the form output after submission;
    - In the Javascript:
        1. Create variables for `form` and `output` (the paragraph);
        2. Add a `submit` event listener that invokes your chosen function;
        3. Replace the hard-coded input variables with ones entered in the form;
        4. Output the result to the `output` element (the paragraph) instead of logging it to the console.

## 2. Booleans and conditional code
### Demo: Refactor temperature calculator
Using booleans and conditional statements convert the `toCelcius` function so that it works both ways:
1. Add `<select>` menu to select `to-celcius` or `to-fahrenheit`;
2. Refactor function to make the correct calculation, based on the menu selection.
