### Process Flowchart
Choose a task or activity that you do often that takes 3-5 minutes to complete, such as:
- Make breakfast
- Get dressed for work
- Brush your teeth

Using a pen/pencil and a sheet of paper:
- Title your process
- Create a flow chart that describes that process
- Take a picture of your flowchart and upload it to Brightspace

Alternatively, you can use an online flowchart tool such as [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com) and upload a PDF and/or share link.
