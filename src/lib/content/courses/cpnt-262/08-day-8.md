### Treasure Hunt: Expressions
In groups of two or three:
1. Find two or three examples of Javascript statements online;
2. How many expressions can you find in each statement?
    - Hint:
        1. Count the literal values;
        2. Count the variables;
        3. Count the operators;
        4. Add them all together.
3. If each expression was converted to a Boolean value, what would it be?

You will be presenting your findings to the rest of the group in the main room.
