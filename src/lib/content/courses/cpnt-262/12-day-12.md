- [Fall 2022 Vue Demo Content Repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content)

## Morning Javascript Activity (20 min)

- [JS Warmup Gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/05fb0d9693b47411fbb6de4609face1a)
  - Refresh on variables
  - Use some conditionals and methods
  - Ask questions and review docs if you get stuck
  - You're not expected to finish all of this in 20 minutes

## Frontend Frameworks

- Frontend Frameworks are designed to make complex websites and applications easier to create. They offer many advances over traditional vanilla html + css + js.
- [Check out Mozillas Documentation on what a frontend framework is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction)
- Frontend Frameworks can be used for:
  - [Single Page Applications -- SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) loads website on the client side
  - [Server Side Rendered -- SSR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction) loads website on the server first
  - [Static Site Generation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) A static prebuilt site is served to the user (SSG like Nuxt will then 'rehydrate' on the client side, providing a dynamic experience)
- Popular Frameworks:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Facebook)
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Google)
  - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (Independent/Community)
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (Independent/Community)

### What's the difference between Vue and Nuxt?

- Nuxt is built using Vue. It is a Vue Framework that offers a lot of functionality built into it
- Vue is the essential core of [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), just like React is the essential core of [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- Nuxt provides project organization, build tool setup, and an easy way to handle modules and plugins, it also offers static site generation out of the box

## Project Setup Walkthrough

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application)
  - install command `npm init vue@latest`
  - Tip: Don't install eslint and prettier at this step. you'll understand what's happening better if you work through it separately.
  - You don't need typescript in this course
  - Add the router

### Activity: Set up a basic vue install and edit files (20 minutes)

- Install vue as we did in the demo
- Edit html in the **template** tags
- Add html to the `App.vue` file as well as the `HomeView.vue` file
  - Take now of how the content is organized
- Add css into the `<style scoped>` tags of each page

## Formatting and Linting Configuration

- Use the Volar Extension
- Check the Readme in [the f22 repo utils branch](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content/tree/utils) for tutorials on setting up prettier and eslint with vue, vite, and tailwind.

#### Anatomy of a Single File Component

```
<script setup>

// Write Javascript here

</script>
<template>

<!-- Write HTML here -->

</template>

<style scoped>

/* Write CSS here */

<style>
```

- All 3 are not always required.
- using `style scoped`, you can keep your css variables bound at the component level, which increases modularity of your code
- You can rearrange the tags in any order.

### Vue Directives Basics

- Vue has a set of templating directives that you can use to add content to a web page. There are lots and they are all useful for different things. Today we will cover a couple basics to get you started
- [Directives List](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html)

#### [`v-bind`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-bind)

- This is one of the most important. it allows you to bind data to html properties such as `src` in an img tag
- You can also use it to bind styles [v-bind css](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#v-bind-in-css)
- It can be written out as `v-bind:src="variableName"` or by using the shorthand `:` as in `:src="variableName`
- Example:

```
<img :src="cat.photo" :alt="cat.description" />
```

### Binding Styles

- You can also bind classes!
- Make content visible/invisible based on specific parameters

```
<p :class="answer == !answer ? 'text-red-500' : 'text-green-500'" class="text-xl">This is some text</p>
```

- In this example, if the variable "answer" was false, then the text would be red, otherwise it would be green

## Vue Composition API vs Options API

- When you look up Vue documentation and examples, you'll find two distinct types of syntax being used. One is the **options api** and the other is the **composition api**.
- The Options API is older and will be eventually replaced by the composition api
- They are both useful ways of structuring the logic for your code. They handle your variables, functions, and props.
- [API Reference Appendix](https://vuejs.org/api/)
- **In this class we will default to the composition api**

### Comparative Example

- Options API

```
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    variableKey: 'Variable Value'
  }
}
</script>
```

- Composition API

```
<script setup>
const variableKey = 'Variable Value'
</script>
```

## Lab Time

- Create javascript variables just like we did this morning in the `<script setup></script>` tags of one of the pages
- Use v-bind syntax from class to render your variables on the page
- Use Conditionals to change the css of something on a page
- Manipulate the variables with JS to render them differently
- Add [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) and style your content
- Configure prettier and eslint as per the notes in the [utils branch](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content/tree/utils)

## Homework

- Steps 1-7 of the [Vue Tutorial](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1)
  - use SFC and Composition modes
- Read:
  - [Vue Introduction](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#the-progressive-framework)
  - [App Configurations](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application.html#app-configurations)
  - [Template Syntax](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html#attribute-bindings)
  - [Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html)
