## 2. Review: `for` loops and arrays
- [10 Simple Javascript For-Loop Exercises](https://avantutor.com/blog/10-simple-javascript-for-loop-exercises/)

---

## 3. `for...of` loops
Which loop is best?
- `for`: when you know how many times you need to run a loop.
- `for...of`: when you have an existing array that you'd like to loop over.

### Materials
- [JavaScript for... of Loop](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/for-of)
- [JavaScript for Beginners #13 - For Of /For Each Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEKDSLwf2Gw)

### Demo: Outputting a bulleted list to the page
**Goal**: take an existing array and print it as a bulleted list by wrapping each item in `<li>` elements. Then, output the list in a `<ul>`.

**Steps**
1. Create an empty `output` variable which will contain a string of the completed `<li>` elements;
2. Loop through the array using `for...of`;
3. At each iteration, add (i.e. concatenate) each array item (surrounded by `<li>` and `</li>` tags) to `output`;
4. After the loop completes, print the completed `output` variable to a `<ul>` on the page using `.innerHTML`.

### Loop exercises
Complete each of the following exercises:
1. Using an array method, output the elements of the following array in reverse order:
    ```js
    let arr = [43, "what", 9, true, "cannot", false, "be", 3, true];
    ```
    - hint: there is an array method that does exactly this.

2. Using a `for` loop, print all even numbers up to and including `n`:
    ```js
    const n = 22;
    // Example output: 
    // 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22
    ```

3. Using a `for...of` loop, print the sum of all elements in the following array:
    ```js
    let integers = [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2]; // --> 276
    ```

**Submission Instructions**
1. Create an `index.html` file with an external `js/app.js` file in your workspace and complete the activity;
    - Clearly comment which Exercise is being completed at each step;
    - You may log all output to the console. 
2. Name your repo `cpnt-262-achievement-13` or similar and push to GitHub;
3. Submit your repo and GH Pages link in Brightspace.

You will be marked proportionally to how many exercises you complete.
