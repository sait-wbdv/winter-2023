## Javascript Warmups: Functions (20 min + 10min debrief)

- [Activity Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)
  - Create functions that make conditional logic reusable

### Debrief Questions

- What kind of use cases could you use this logic on a web page? (_each group will need to discuss at least 1 of their solutions_)
- What are your preferences for syntax style? and why?

## Vue Directives

Vue Directives are used to render and manipulate data on a page. The most common is the [v-bind](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-bind) which we discussed yesterday.

### V-bind and Attributes

- Render text from JS using double moustach syntax `{{ variableName }}`
- Pass JS variables to attributes using `v-bind:` or `:`. ex: `<img :src="varName.src" :alt="varName.alt" />`
- Bind [css styles](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#v-bind-in-css)
  - See an example using functions [here](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content)
- pass props to components (what we will do after lunch)

### Activity: Bind Two Attributes

- Bind an image's src and alt tags to an an object
  - example object: `const image = {url: 'https://imageurl.com', alt: 'this is some text'}`
- Bind a class to styles declared in a variable
  - example variable: `const textStyle = 'text-2xl text-red-200'`
  - _if the first example is comfortable, try using a conditional to determine the styles of a variable_

## Setting up Eslint and Prettier with Vue and Tailwind

- [Ashlyn's Utils branch](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/f22-vue-content/tree/utils)
  - This branch has tips in the readme plus functioning code examples (will be merged to main after class)

## Lab Time

- [Vue Tutorial](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1): Structured 15 step set of activities
- Create new "views" and add them to the router [docs](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- Create a number counter with v-on
- Make variables change color depending on the state of a switch that is controlled using v-on
