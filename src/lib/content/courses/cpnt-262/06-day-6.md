## 2. `Element.classList` API
[![Slides - Changing CSS with Javascript](/images/slides/js-changing-css.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/f22/cpnt-262/js-changing-css.html)

### Materials
- [`Element.classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

### Demo: Dark mode toggle
Let's build a checkbox that adds/removes a `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element that changes a page's `color` and `background-color`.
- [Starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f22/tree/main/2022-10-24-changing-css/01-starter-classlist)

### Activity
In groups of 2-3, create a button or checkbox that:
- uses `classList` to add/remove a `hide` class on another element;
- makes a paragraph (or other page content) disappears and appears when a `hide` class is added/removed.

## 3. CSS Variables
### Materials
- [Using CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

### Demo: Colour slider
If we have time, let's add a colour slider that changes the colour angle of both light and dark modes at the same time.
