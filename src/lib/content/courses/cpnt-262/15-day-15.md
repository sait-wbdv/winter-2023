## List Rendering and v-for

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html)
- Follow up with notes from yesterday

### Activity: Render an Array using a v-for

- Create an array of strings in your script tags of HomeView
- Create a ul and put a v-for on an li inside of it
- Follow the abovenoted documentation for syntax
- Render the strings in a list

## Conditional Directives

- [Conditional Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html#conditional-rendering)
- [v-if](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-if),v-else, and v-else-if: Render content conditionally. This will remove and add content in the DOM.
- [v-show](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-show): This will make content visible and invisible by setting the display to none or block (use for things that get toggled a lot). it's a lighter visibility switch than v-if/else. [tutorial that compares v-if to v-show](https://learnvue.co/tutorials/v-if-vs-v-show)

### Use Cases

- to display content conditionally
- show the user specific info depending on the situation
- error handling
- accomodating variations in layout

### Activity: Set content to show conditionally

- Set a boolean value in the script
- use v-if and v-else to make the content disappear and reappear

### Event Directive

- [v-on](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-on) for handling events and functions (use this for things like your hamburger menu)

## Event Handling

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling.html)
- [v-on gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/74543137780c1958f01e9b470a3cb13b) with notes on how to use `v-on`
- `v-on` is used to listen to DOM events and trigger a javascript handler (often a function)
- syntax: `v-on:click="handler"`
  - or shortened as`@click="handler`
- Use this for any buttons on a page
  - set the handler to be a function
- This can be used with the [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) to make variables more reactive

### Event Modifiers

- To stop a form from being submitted when using a `<button>`, or to stop other default behaviour, use `.prevent`
  - `@click.prevent="myFunction`
  - Check out the other event modifiers
    - `@click.once` - will only trigger once
    - `@click.passive` - great for touch events
  - Key modifiers allow for effecting how an event handler is triggered
  - You can specify specific keys using key aliases and key modifiers

#### Creating Switches

- To make reactive switches, you'll want to use the following syntax
- `let variable = reactive({val: false})`
  - this will make a reactive variable that response to v-on well
- `const variableSwitch = () => variable.val = !variable.val`
  - this will create a switch that changes the variable to false
- `<button @click.prevent="variableSwitch">Click me</button>`
  - note that this doesn't need to be a button

### Activity: Make a toggle

- Create a toggle for the v-if that we made in the last activity
- Add a `@click.prevent` directive to a button
- Make the event switch the boolean variable between true and false
  - `variable = !variable`
- See your content change!

## Lab Time

- Work on your assignment
- Practice using vue directives to render content
- Look at an old project and map out how you would organize the code into components and pages (pen and paper or whatever medium works)
