<Achievement {status} dueDate={false}>

### Classic Interview Question: FizzBuzz
**FizzBuzz** is the classic exercise you could get in interviews:
- You get a list of numbers from 1 to N.
- When a number is divisible by 3, change the output value to "Fizz".
- When a number is divisible by 5, change the value to "Buzz".
- When a number  is divisible by **both** 3 _and_ 5, change the value to "FizzBuzz".
- If none of the above apply, we just output the number.

**Instructions**
In groups of 2 or 3, complete the FizzBuzz challenge using this starter code:
- [Print 1-to-100 with a `for` Loop](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/e87aa5564ae1b286beca66b07d52550f)
