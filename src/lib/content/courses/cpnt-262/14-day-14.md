## Assignment 3: Crafting Components

- Due Monday November 21st
- Weight: 10%
- Build and apply 5 components to a Vue app

## Props

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.htm)
- Props are a convention in many frameworks, they refer to how variables are passed between parent and child components
- By using props, you can set a component's layout to be specific about how it displays information from the parent component
- Note that the options api and composition api use different syntax to define props
- Props are a **one way data flow** from parent to child (page to component)

### Tips

- When defining props, make sure to define their variable type (ie: string, array...)

### Activity

- Set up a prop on your `AppHeader.vue` component
- use it to take the page title and description text from the `app.vue` page. This component would take the h1 tag content and actions

---

## Components

- [Vue Components Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html)
- Single File Components are nested within one another and on pages to build a website.
- Follow [the style guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/) on naming components
- You will need to use es6 import syntax to add components to vue files (in nuxt, this behaviour requires less work)

### Why components?

- components allow you to create reusable code (edit once, fix everywhere)
- They make it easier to spot errors
- They also make it easier to upgrade your code over time
- Modularity is awesome

### Component Naming

- 2+ word names
- Prefix general components with **App**, **V**, or **Base**
  - ie: `AppHeader.vue` for page headers, `AppList.vue`and `AppListItem.vue`
- Prefix UI components that only show up once per page with **The**
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - ie:
    - `TheNav.vue`
    - `TheNavLink.vue`
    - `TheFooter.vue`
    - `AppCard.vue`
    - `AppCardImage.vue`
    - and so on...

### Activity: Setting up a Layout Component

- Create an `AppHeader.vue` component and add it to an `app.vue` page
- set up your props:
  - background color
  - h1 headline text
  - paragraph description text
- Apply your AppHeader to the HomeView and AboutView
- Create an `AppButton.vue` component and set it to take text as a prop
  - Add it to the header

### Types of Components

- Note: For small projects, you can keep all your components in the `components` folder. Your naming convention should be consistent to allow for easy searching.
- However it can be helpful to organize your code into subfolders too
- UI
  - Specific, used for UI elements like the navbar, footer, dashboards (anything that has recurring information)
- Layout
  - Generic, used to organize information, might contain some recurring component specific content
  - page headers, sections, gallery layouts
- Utilities
  - Generic, small components such as buttons, links, headlines. These can make great use of slots as well as props

### Activity: Set up UI and Utility Components

- Create a topbar component called either `TheHeader.vue` or `TheNav.vue`, create reusable child components such as `TheNavLink.vue`
  - Set them up to take placeholder text as props
  - Use them to make a topbar (if you genrally use different conventions, feel free to change it up)
  - Add the topbar to `App.vue`
  - Don't worry about adding lots of styles, focus on making sure that the data renders correctly first

### Tips

### Activity

- Set up a prop on your `AppHeader.vue` component
- use it to take the page title and hero description text from the `app.vue` page

## List Rendering

- [Vue List Rendering Docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html)
- Use v-for to render a loop of information
- It **must** have a key added. which should be the name of the iterator + .id
- example (will print out a list of hero names providing that `heroes` exists as a list)
- `v-for` is one of the most used directives along with v-bind and v-on
- when you specific `item in items` the "items" must refer to the actual variable that you're iterating through, but the word "item" can be anything that you want to use as an interator

```
<ul>
  <li v-for="hero in heroes" :key="hero.id">
  {{ hero.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```
