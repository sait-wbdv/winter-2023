## 2. Demo: Strapi Installation and Content-type Builder
### Materials
- [User Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html)
- Slides: [Strapi Content Types](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/f22/cpnt-200/strapi-content-types.html)

### Instructions
See: [Strapi Quick Start Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html)
1. Create a new project
    ```
    $ npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project --quickstart
    ```

    - Potential installation problems
        - **Port conflict**: for example, Razor keyboards also use port 1337
            - Solution
                1. Change Strapi port to 1338 (for exmaple) in `.env` file;
                2. Rebuild your project
                    ```
                    $ npm run build
                    ```
                3. Run development server
                    ```
                    $ npm run develop
                    ```
        - Windows users:
            - Node not installed
                - [Binary installer for Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
                - Can also use [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools)
                    - Select "Desktop Development with C++"
            - Python not installed
                - Install with [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools)?


2. [Register the first administrator user](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-2-register-the-first-administrator-user)
3. [Create collection types with the Content-type Builder](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-1-create-collection-types-with-the-content-type-builder)
4. [Create new entries](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-2-use-the-collection-types-to-create-new-entries)
5. [Set Roles & Permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-3-set-roles-permissions)
6. [Publish the content](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-4-publish-the-content)
7. [Create API token](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.html#managing-api-tokens)
    - Note: you only see the token once. Copy and Paste token somewhere safe, like a `.env` file in the root of your project:
        ```
        API_TOKEN=asdlfandsfj8373nehd93hdk...
        ```
    - Using your token for requests:
        1. Open Postman;
        2. Enter your endpoint URL:
            ```
            http://localhost:1337/api/articles
            ```
            - You should get an "UnauthorizedError" because you didn't supply a token;
        3. Go to Authorization in Postman to add your token:
            - Type: Bearer Token;
            - Token: Paste the token you copied from Strapi;
        4. Re-submit request and you should now receive the list of items.

## 3. Demo: Enumeration vs Relation fields
### Materials
- Slides: [Strapi Content Types](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/f22/cpnt-200/strapi-content-types.html)
- [Enumeration fields](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/latest/content-types-builder/configuring-fields-content-type.html#enumeration)
- Relation fields
    - [Understanding and using Relations in Strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/understanding-and-using-relations-in-strapi)
    - [Managing relational fields](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/latest/content-manager/managing-relational-fields.html)

### Notes and gotchas
- If you edit a Relation after Entries have been added, you will need to re-set the Relation values in each Entry. Moral: add the minimum amount of content until you've finalized your Model to save you some time.
- The Strapi API won't retrieve Relation data by default. You have to explicitly request the Relations with a `populate` query parameter:
    ```
    http://localhost:1338/api/resources?populate=*
    ```
