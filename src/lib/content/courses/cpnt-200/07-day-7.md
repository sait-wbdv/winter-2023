<Achievement {status} dueDate={false}>

Due tonight (Friday) at 11:59pm in Brightspace.

## Achievement 7
### 10 points: Custom database from Google Sheet
Import the Google Sheet you created for Achievement 6 and import it into Supabase:

### Instructions
1. Export each Google Sheet as a CSV file;
2. In Supabase, create each table by importing its respective CSV and:
		- Prepend your table names with `ach7` to separate from any other tables in your project;
		- _Enable_ RLS;
		- set `id` as primary;
		- set an appropriate data type (use `text` instead of `varchar`);
		- allow `NULL` as needed.
3. Add appropriate foreign keys for all one-to-many relationships;
4. Add a policy to each table that allows anyone to read the table.
5. Create SvelteKit routes:
		- **List Entry page** - display a list or gallery of items from your database. Each item should be linked to its respective item route
		- **Dynamic Item Route** - display an item based on a route parameter. Use a Supabase filter such as `.eq()` to select the single item from your database.
