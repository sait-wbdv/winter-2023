## 1. Slides: The Browser Triad
[![The Browser Triad](/images/slides/browser-triad.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-260/browser-triad.html)

### Quiz time: UI Icons and the Triad
[![UI Quiz Slides](/images/slides/ui-quiz.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-260/ui-triad-quiz.html)
In groups of 3-4: 
1. Discuss each of the User Interface icons listed in the above;
2. Decide on which Triad technology (HTML, CSS, JS) the icon is most associated;
3. Report your answers in the main room.

**Wiki markup**
Using openly licensed text of your choice (i.e. from Wikipedia or similar source). Code it in a valid HTML `index.html` page. 

Your page should contain the following HTML tags:
- `<h1>`-`<h3>`: headings
- `<p>`: paragraphs
- `<a>`: links
- `<strong>`, `<em>`: bold and italicize
- `<ul>` and/or `<ol>`: unordered and ordered lists

## 3. Setting up `dailies`, `projects` and `assignments` directories
It's recommended that you set up the following directories in your workspace:
1. `dailies` for day-to-day code as one repo:
    ```
    /dailies
        /2022-09-19-box-model
            /topic-1
            /topic-2
        /2022-09-20
            /more-topics
    ```
2. `projects` for misc repos
    ```
    /projects
       /portfolio-site
       /moms-bakery
       /client-1
    ```
3. `assignments` for repos that contain WBDV assessments to be handed in:
    ```
    /cpnt-260
        /assignment-1
        /assignment-2
        /etc
    /cpnt-262
        /assignment-1
        /etc
    ```

### Demo: Codepen Challenge
**Instructions**
1. Copy and paste the code of [this empty HTML file](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6871979b4f4b04375edb6312dcdba5b7) into a file named `index.html`. Place this file inside it's own repo named `codepen-challenge`.
2. Move the code inside the Codepen HTML panel to a `<body>` element of an empty HTML page named `index.html`;
3. Move the code inside the CSS panel to a `<style>` element inside `<head>` element of the same HTML page;
4. Move the code inside the JS panel, if it exists, to a `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>` element of the HTML page;
5. Confirm the page is working as expected;
6. Push `index.html` to a GH repo named `codepen-challenge` and enable GH Pages;

### Treasure hunt
Find a video (> 10 mins) about HTML/CSS that interests you. It should be current, helpful and come from a credible source.

We will discuss your submissions in class, asking:
- Why does this video/article interest you?
- Given the date of publication, is it still relevant?
- How do you know the author is credible?
