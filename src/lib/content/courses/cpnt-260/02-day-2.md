- Search: "`codepen tutorial`" or similar

### Lab: Pair-coding
In groups of two, decide on which lab you'd like to collab on.

See: [Introduction to Pair Programming](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/caa20b2520814a94240043c40301024a) with Fiona and Semira

**Wiki markup**
Use openly licensed text of your choice from Wikipedia or similar service. Code it in HTML using Codepen. Start with the following HTML tags:
- `h1`-`h3`: headings
- `p`: paragraphs
- `a`: links
- `strong`, `em`: bold and italicize
- `ul` and/or `ol`: unordered and ordered lists

## 3. Setting up `dailies`, `projects` and `assignments` directories
It's recommended that you set up the following directories in your workspace:
1. `dailies` for day-to-day code as one repo:
    ```
    /dailies
        /2022-09-19-box-model
            /topic-1
            /topic-2
        /2022-09-20
            /more-topics
    ```
2. `projects` for misc repos
    ```
    /projects
       /portfolio-site
       /moms-bakery
       /client-1
    ```
3. `assignments` for repos that contain WBDV assessments to be handed in:
    ```
    /cpnt-260
        /assignment-1
        /assignment-2
        /etc
    /cpnt-262
        /assignment-1
        /etc
    ```

### Demo: Codepen Challenge
**Instructions**
1. Copy and paste the code of [this empty HTML file](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6871979b4f4b04375edb6312dcdba5b7) into a file named `index.html`. Place this file inside it's own repo named `codepen-challenge`.
2. Move the code inside the Codepen HTML panel to a `<body>` element of an empty HTML page named `index.html`;
3. Move the code inside the CSS panel to a `<style>` element inside `<head>` element of the same HTML page;
4. Move the code inside the JS panel, if it exists, to a `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>` element of the HTML page;
5. Confirm the page is working as expected;
6. Push `index.html` to a GH repo named `codepen-challenge` and enable GH Pages;
