### Box Model Styles
#### Proof of work
Feel free to play around and experiment with different properties and HTML elements. You will be marked based on honest effort.

If you have trouble thinking of styles to apply, try the following:
1. **Customize headings**: Use one or more of the following properties to customize the appearance of your headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc):
    - Add a background color with [`background-color`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-color/) (and add [`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) so the text doesn't touch the edge);
    - Add an accent line using [`border-left`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left) or [`border-bottom`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom);
    - Remove the bold style using [`font-weight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight);
    - Centre the text within the heading using [`text-align`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align);
2. **Limit body text to a readable line length**:
    - Use the [`max-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width) property to limit the line length of your text to `650px` (or similar);
        - Hint: you can apply this to a container (i.e. `<body>` or `<main>`) to affect all text inside the container.
    - Italicize the first paragraph using [`font-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) and a [class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors);
3. **Center body text on the page**:
    - Use [`margin: auto`](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css-margin-auto/) to add equal spacing to the sides of a container of body text;
    - Note: this will only work if the container width is less than 100%;
4. **Customize list styles**:
    - Customize a list using one of the methods shown in the article: [List Style Recipes ](https://css-tricks.com/list-style-recipes/);
