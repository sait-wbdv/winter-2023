### Web Typography
#### Proof of work
1. **Define your page typography**: 
    - Declare your body text font using the `font-family` declaration and on the `body` tag. 
    - Include settings for `line-height` (default is `1.2`; try for `1.5`-`2`) and increase the `font-size` to something larger than `16px` (the default on most browsers):
        ```css
        body {
          font-family: Arial Black, Gadget, sans-serif;
          font-size: 18px;
          line-height: 1.6;
        }
        ```
2. **Limit your text to a readable line length**:
    - Use the `max-width` property to limit the line length of your text to `85ch`;
        - Hint: you can apply this to a container (i.e. `<body>` or `<main>`) to affect all text inside the container.
3. **Center a container**:
    - Use `margin: auto` to add equal spacing to the sides of a container;
    - Note: this will only work if the container width is less than 100%;
4. **Declare a Display font**: Declare a secondary font on your headings using a group selector:
    
    ```css
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      font-family: Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Palatino, serif;
    }
    ```
