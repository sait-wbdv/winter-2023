### Activity: Asset inventory
1. Create a Github Project (Beta) labelled "Asset inventory"
2. Find image assets (file system, online, wherever) that you'd like to use for a project.
    - if you don't have any images handy, add a Card to your Project labelled "Find some cool images"
3. Categorize your images:
    - Is it a high or low frequency image (on average)?
    - Would it be better suited to be a JPEG or PNG image?
    - If your image is in the wrong format, add a Card to your Project labelled "Convert [image-label] to [preferred-format]"

### Show and Tell
- Show off your favourite images and talk about them for 2.5-7.5 minutes.
    - **10 points**, just sayin'...

### Web Typography
#### Proof of work
1. **Define your page typography**: 
    - Declare your body text font using the `font-family` declaration and on the `body` tag. 
    - Include settings for `line-height` (default is `1.2`; try for `1.5`-`2`) and increase the `font-size` to something larger than `16px` (the default on most browsers):
        ```css
        body {
          font-family: Arial Black, Gadget, sans-serif;
          font-size: 18px;
          line-height: 1.6;
        }
        ```
2. **Declare a Display font**: Declare a secondary font on your headings using a group selector:
    
    ```css
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      font-family: Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Palatino, serif;
    }
    ```
