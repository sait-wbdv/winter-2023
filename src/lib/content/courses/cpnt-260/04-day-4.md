### Slides
[![Raster Image Slides](/images/slides/raster-html-images.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-260/html-images.html)

### Activity: Asset inventory
1. Create a Github Project (Beta) labelled "Asset inventory"
2. Find image assets (file system, online, wherever) that you'd like to use for a project.
    - if you don't have any images handy, add a Card to your Project labelled "Find some cool images"
3. Categorize your images:
    - Is it a high or low frequency image (on average)?
    - Would it be better suited to be a JPEG or PNG image?
    - If your image is in the wrong format, add a Card to your Project labelled "Convert [image-label] to [preferred-format]"

### Show and Tell
- Show off your favourite images and talk about them for 2.5-7.5 minutes.
    - **10 points**, just sayin'...
