## 1. Hack session: Codepen export to GitHub Pages?
If we can figure out how to easily publish a Codepen to GH Pages, you can submit Pens for Assignments 3 & 4.

### Instructions for exporting a Pen
1. Export Codepen as a ZIP;
2. Expand the ZIP;
3. Copy the following files to a new GH repo;
    - `/dist/index.html` -> `/index.html`
    - `/dist/style.css` -> `/css/style.css`
    - `/dist/script.js` -> `/js/script.js`, if applicable
4. Enable GH Pages;
5. Submit to Brightspace as normal.
