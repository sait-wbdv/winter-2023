Try to duplicate a horizontal navigation menu and banner using the above sample code.

Search for an example of a horizontal navigation menu online that you think you can duplicate.
- Which of the "horizontal menu" examples above best fit your selected menu? Are other Flexbox properties required to achieve the desired effect?
- How much `padding` needs to be added to the `a` element?
- What colours are used? How do you find this information? What elements are the colours applied to?
