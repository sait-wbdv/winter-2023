3. Choose of white or black as your neutral (60%) and primary 30% colours;
4. Using HSL and colour harmonies, make small tweaks to white and black to create light and dark complimentary colours to match your Call-to-Action colour.
5. Create a clickable link using your colour palette:
    - Neutral -> background colour
    - Call-to-action -> link background colour
    - Primary -> link text
    - Reverse link and link text colours on `:hover`
6. Add a paragraph with a box (i.e. card) to your link and build from there.
