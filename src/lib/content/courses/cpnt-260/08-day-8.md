## Activity: Hero Section
Create your own full-viewport hero section:
1. Select an large-format image on your file system or on Lorem Picsum for your background image;
2. Create a full-viewport `<header>` with a height of `100vh`;
3. Add a CSS background image using the image you selected;
4. Add HTML content of your choice to the `<header>`;
5. Using Flexbox (of Grid), position your content over top your background image so that it's pretty and readable.
