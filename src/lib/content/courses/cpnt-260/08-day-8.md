## Activity: Hero Section
Create your own full-viewport hero section:
1. Select an large-format image on your file system or on Lorem Picsum for your background image;
2. Create a full-viewport `<header>` with a height of `100vh`;
3. Add a CSS background image using the image you selected;
4. Add HTML content of your choice to the `<header>`;
5. Using Flexbox (of Grid), position your content over top your background image so that it's pretty and readable.

### Creating a Call-to-Action Card
We learned how to create a hero section in class but Assignment 4 also requires a Call-to-Action like this example:

![Screencap of a Call-to-Action](/images/assessments/cta-card.png)

#### Proof of Work
Using the provided [starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-w23/tree/main/2023-02-01-hero-sections-hsl/01-achievement-starter), create a CTA card with HSL color definitions:
1. Limit the width of the card to `40ch` with `max-width`;
2. Add `margin` and `padding` to center the card on the page and push text away from the card edge;
3. Redefine the colour pallette using the HSL colour model:
    1. Pick a favourite primary colour and convert it to HSL with a web colour converter;
    2. Create complimentary, light, dark and contrasting colours by changing the Hue, Saturation and Lightness values of your chosen colours.
    3. Stuck? Try using a [colour pallette generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=colour+pallette+generator) or [create one from an image](https://www.google.com/search?q=colour+palette+generator+from+image).
4. Make the CTA link more clickable:
    1. Remove the underline with `text-decoration`;
    2. Make the link more "buttony" with `padding`;
        - optional: add a `border` and/or round the corners with `border-radius`;
    3. Use a complimentary colour for the link [`:hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) and [`:visited`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited) states;
    4. Use a contrasting colour for the link [`:active`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active) state.
    4. Optional: centre the button on the card.

**Submission Instructions**
1. Create your project in a `index.html` file;
2. Add your CSS as an external style sheet located inside a `css` directory;
3. Name your repo `cpnt-260-achievement-8` or similar;
4. Submit your repo and GH Pages link in Brightspace.

#### Learning and Reflection
What is one real-life application for a Call-to-Action that you'd use in a project?
