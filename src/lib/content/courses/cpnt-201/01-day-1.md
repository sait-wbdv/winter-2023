## 3. Command line basics

Command line is very powerful and it's really helpful for a developer to be familiar with it. There are GUI tools that allow you to work without it as well, but knowing how your computer organizes files, and how to get around from a code perspective is an asset.

### Materials

## Lab Time

- Work on assignments
- Play [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com)

### CPNT-201 Achievement-1

#### Proof of Work

1. Download and extract the zip file for: [Follow the White Rabbit](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6e3b69b7f2a81573d683b716fb069296) (make sure to also extract the inner directory)
2. Using a command line (unix), search through the directories to find the white rabbit image
3. As you are searching,

#### Exit Ticket Questions

1. What is the command line?
2. Why should you **not** put spaces in file names
3. Do we use the Unix or Dos command line in this course?

#### Submission Instructions

    - screen cap each command that you used along with it's output
    - label screenshots by step like:
    	- `01-pwd`
    	- `02-cd`
    	- `03-ls`
    	- etc.
    	- You can group commands in a single screenshot if you like, try to keep each screenshot grouped as steps. The goal is to think about moving around your filesystem in a series of steps.
    		- Review the supplied notes on what each command does and think about what your trying to achieve before you write a given command to make sure that it'll do what you expect.
