## Collaborative Git Projects

- Git makes collaborating on code more effecient and structured
- But team members need to come up with rules and follow them
- Merge conflicts, bad git commit messages, pushed broken code, and general miscommunication are all very damaging to a well functioning dev team
- It's important to establish your teams guidelines early - and to reinforce them (this can be uncomfortable, but necessary to protect the integrity of the code)
- Limit files that you edit when in a branch to **only** be files relevant to the feature that you're working on.

## Code Reviews

- Reviewing other people's code is a great way to improve your own coding
- Read through the code line by line, use github's commit tab in the pull request to be able to go through the persons code
- When commenting on things, consider whether the issue is a code style, or functionality issue (is it a matter of the code looking a certain way or is there a logic problem)

## Code Linting and Formatting

A lot of issues with code can be fixed by simply using formatters and linters to clean up small errors and standardize the formatting

### Code Linter

- Linters fix logic problems in your code
- Configure eslint to be as strict or as lax as you want
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Configure Eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/)
- [Blog post on eslint in vscode](https://www.robinwieruch.de/vscode-eslint/)
- Eslint can also handle formatting, but it's better to pair it with a formatter like prettier
- use a configuration file for eslint to set up your rules: [docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)

### Code Formatter

- Code formatters fix the style of the code but are not concerned with logic
- If you use a formatter with a linter, you need to set up vscode properly so that they work together instead of fighting each other
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Blog Post on setting up prettier](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/)
- use a config file for prettier just like as with eslint [prettier config file docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)

#### Setting up Eslint and Prettier to work together

- Configure eslint and prettier to work together. Otherwise, they may overwrite one another on save which will put you in an endless loop
- [prettier official documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html)
- [blog post instructions](https://www.robinwieruch.de/prettier-eslint/)

## Lab Time

- [Achievement 8: Merge a Pull Request](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/178d16cda841f74d60deb226626083c9)
  - Use this achievement to practice setting up formatters and linters to make your life easier.
  - **recommended** take some notes the setup that worked best for you, and on which configurations you like the most.
    - use these to improve your code quality in future work

### Assignment 4

- Due March 12
- Instructions for: [Assignment 4](/assessments/cpnt-201/assignment-4)
- **Group Achievement**
