## Global Gitignore

A global gitignore can be used to simplify your git experience and keep OS level project files out of your remote repository

- [Set up instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files)
- This is handy to use, but for projects with multiple devs, it's particularly good to still have a project specific gitignore (as not everyone has a global gitignore or the same gitignore as you)

## Branches in Git

Organize your development and protect the production(main) branch

### Git Branch Basics

- Branches are versions of your code that you can work on without touching the original version
- Use branches for the following reasons:
  - feature development
  - bugfix
  - test new ideas
  - avoid merge conflicts while others work on the same code
- Dev teams usually have rules for how team members are expected to work
  - ie: everyone branches from the `development` branch and then merges to `main` are decided on as a team
  - another example is to just have feature branches from `main` and to merge down to main when ready

#### Pull Request

- A pull request is how you merge the code from one branch to another
- Open a Pull Request in Github
- Pull Requests should be reviewed by a different team member before they are merged down
- Use the comment area in the Pull Request to communicate changes.
  - This keeps the workflow close to the code and allows you to easily point out lines that may need changes when doing a code review
- Pull Requests bundle commits to make them easier to review as a group
  - It's important to only work on the feature that is relevant to the Pull Request
  - Use this workflow to improve your focus and strategy about how you code
