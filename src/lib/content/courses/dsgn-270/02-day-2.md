### Activity: Usability and good/bad design of items from home

- In small groups, talk about the items that you found around your house
  - In what way are they good or bad design
  - Are there any mental models or metaphors at play with your item? or is that item the basis for a digital metaphor (think about the mental models video)
- After about 15 minutes discuss items as a class (1 or 2 from each group)
  - If you didn't participate in the first debrief, participate in this one

### Break 15 Minutes

To make content **scannable** and hierarchically organized, we use a variety of UI elements to organize content.

For your assignment 1, you will be finding screenshots of UI elements that you like and fit your design concept for inspiration

### Important Elements

- Headers
- Navigation (a class of elements in it's own)
- Lists
- Cards
- Footers
- Hero Sections

#### Small Group Activity
