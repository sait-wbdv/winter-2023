## Wireframes

Wireframing can take a few different forms. Generally think of it as a quick sketch of a site/app.

**[Slides: Wireframes](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/dsgn-270/wireframes.html)**

## Common Elements in Wireframes

- square: most wireframing involves blocking out content with simple squares
- square with x: it's common to use a square with an x through it to denote foreground images
- Text Boxes: Text is often depicted with either placeholder text (medium resolution lorem ipsum), squiggles, lines, or boxes
- Notes: use comments or small frames to the side of your wireframe to put usability notes

## Activities

Throughout the day we will do these activities to develop our wireframing skills

### Activity 1: Create a User Flow (15 min)

_from the pov of a user_

- Choose from one of the following options:
  - Shopping for something
  - Signing up for a service
  - Learning about an event or activity
- Using figjam or figma, create a card sort to document the steps that you can invision needing to do to achieve that goal
- **Debrief Question**
  - In your experience, does the amount of steps that you assume you'd need to do to accomplish a task with a site or app match the steps that you have to actually do? Give an example of a site or app that has matched expectations.

### Activity 2: Pen and Paper Wireframe (15 min)

- Pen and Paper Only
- Sketch a lofi wireframe of the following content (get as much done as you can in 15 min, the goal is to go with your intuition and quickly)
- **only use basic shapes**
- Content Outline:
  - A navbar with 3 links and a logo
  - A header that has a title, description, foreground **or** background image, and at least 1 button
  - 1 section of content
    - ie: card layout, small gallery, info section, video section...
  - A footer

### Activity 3: Wireframe in Figma (15 min)

- Sketch a wireframe of a card design
  - Use a layout that you're familiar
  - Use shapes as demonstrated in class
- **Debrief Question**
  - what is more natural for you? wireframing by hand or with a design tool like Figma?
