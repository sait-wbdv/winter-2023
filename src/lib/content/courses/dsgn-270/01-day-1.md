### Breakout discussion
In groups of 3-4, discuss some domain-specific terms that you use from other fields in your life? In other words:
- What areas of knowledge do you know that most others don't?
- What terms do you sometimes use that confuse your friends, family or colleagues?
- Are there any everyday terms that also have special meaning in another field?
