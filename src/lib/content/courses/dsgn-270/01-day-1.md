- This is a useful strategy early on in a project. It helps:
  - Find patterns
  - See which ideas are common in a group
  - Break out of ruts

## What is a Moodboard?

- Ways to establish a design concept
- Find inspiration for color, typefaces, tone, imagery, emotion, identity...
- Moodboards are used to communicate with clients, to establish a base pattern of styles, to gather stock content, and to brainstorm
- Tools commonly used:
  - Figma or Figjam
  - Pinterest (great for getting your client to drop ideas into a space for you to look at)
  - Any other whiteboarding software could work
  - Manually with pen, paper, and images
