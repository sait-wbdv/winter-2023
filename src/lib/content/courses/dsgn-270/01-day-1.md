## DSGN 270 Introduction

DSGN 270 is all about User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design for Developers. We will take a practical approach to learning the theory and application of design in web development.

### Software Setup
- Set up a Figma Account
### Affinity Map Activity
- [Gamestorming Affinity Map Activity](https://gamestorming.com/?s=affinity+map)
- Time: 30* minutes
- In Figjam we will collaboratively write down ideas that stood out in our networking session
- Then we will take a few minutes to group them into clusters
- This is a useful strategy early on in a project. It helps:
  - Find patterns
  - See which ideas are common in a group
  - Break out of ruts


## Homework
- Read: [Usability 101: NN Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)
- Watch: [UX Design Basics: Mental Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gM8K4ooavY)
- Skim Chapters 1, 2, 3 of "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug
- Find an item in your house that represents either good or bad design (we will be discussing these in class tomorrow)
