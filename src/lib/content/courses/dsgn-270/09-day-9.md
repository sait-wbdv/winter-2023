## Prototyping

Protoyping adds functionality to your design. This includes navigation between pages, navigation on pages, animations and movement of elements

### Prototyping Basics

- In the left panel, select `Prototype`
- From here you'll be able to set prototype features onto your pages
- To create good prototypes, you'll be duplicating your frames to set before and after states for your various prototype features
- Be really happy with your mockup before you do too much prototyping (links get copied and this can get messy)
- clean up your design

#### Main steps in prototyping

- Group your frames based on the type of prototypes you're doing
- Set up your before and after states
- Make sure that you're on the prototype setting
- Link the state changes
- Set the interaction details
  - animation type
  - interaction
  - destination
  - time

#### Things to prototype

- top bar navigation
- mobile menu slide in
- hover states (buttons)
- image carosel
- anchor links

### Activity: Test out Prototyping (20min)

- Duplicate your mockup
- Change something on it (pick something that you would like to animate)
- Set up the animation to work as discussed

#### Debrief

- Show off your prototype's behaviour
