## Prototyping

Protoyping adds functionality to your design. This includes navigation between pages, navigation on pages, animations and movement of elements

### Prototyping Basics

- In the left panel, select `Prototype`
- From here you'll be able to set prototype features onto your pages
- To create good prototypes, you'll be duplicating your frames to set before and after states for your various prototype features
- Be really happy with your mockup before you do too much prototyping (links get copied and this can get messy)
- clean up your design

#### Main steps in prototyping

- Group your frames based on the type of prototypes you're doing
- Set up your before and after states
- Make sure that you're on the prototype setting
- Link the state changes
- Set the interaction details
  - animation type
  - interaction
  - destination
  - time

#### Things to prototype

- top bar navigation
- mobile menu slide in
- hover states (buttons)
- image carosel
- anchor links

### Activity: Prototype a Button (30min)

- Create a frame (it can be in any file as long as you have access to your button components)
- Add a button to it
- Create a second frame, put a variant of the button on it (the frames should be the **exact** same size and the button should be in the same position)
- Switch from **Design** mode to **Prototype** mode in the upper right hand part of the menu
- link the node from the button (not the frame) to the second frame and set it to transition on mouse enter
- link the node from the second button to the 1st frame and set it to transition on mouse leave
- **Done!** This simulates the basics of using prototying to demonstrate how a button works

#### Extra

- Make a third frame just like the first 2, but use a lighter bg color for the button, and use the same border shadow as the first frame
- Connect the button from the second frame to the third frame (set it to trigger on **mouse down**)
- Set up the third button to connect to the second frame (trigger on **mouse up**)

## Lab Time

- [Achievement: Create a Figma Prototype](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/e92facc0adf02eda65398e1b331de865)
  - this builds off of the work done in your last achievement
