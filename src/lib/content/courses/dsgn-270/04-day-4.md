## 1. Intro to Figma: Vector Design Tool

Before we worked with Figjam as a planning tool, now we will be using Figma as a design tool.

[![Figma Design](/images/slides/figma-intro.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/dsgn-270/figma.html)

### Activity: Play with Shapes! (15 min)

- Open up a figma file
- Create a simple geometric logo
  - use rectangles, ellipses, and/or polygons to create a simple design
  - use at least 2 colors
- have fun, explore using the different shapes

#### Debrief Questions

- What is/is not intuitive about how the tools are organized?
- What is one thing you'd like to be able to design?

## 2. Demo: Tracing with the Pen Tool

### Materials

- [Using Shape Tools](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450133-Using-Shape-Tools)
- [Vector Networks](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks)
- See [All Figma Guides](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks)

### Activity: The Bezier Game!

- [Link to Game](https://bezier.method.ac/)
  - In groups of 4 Try creating as many images as you can with the bezier tool
  - All vector design programs have a version of the pen tool that follows the same basic principles
- 15 minutes
  - Take turns screen sharing and learn from one another
- Debrief: each group show 1 **aha** moment that you had while working on this

## 3. Demo: Boolean operations

[![Booleans](/images/slides/booleans.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/dsgn-270/booleans.html)

- Definitions from: [Boolean Operations in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957534-Boolean-Operations)

### Activity: Try Each Boolean

- Search up simple logos and icons and try one of each
- It can be helpful to divy up the roles among your team so each of you has experience with one and can guide the others a bit
- Debrief: show an example of each boolean
