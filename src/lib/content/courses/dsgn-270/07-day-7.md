## Assignment 4 Website Mockup

- Due February 21

<LessonPlan {status}>

## Figma Mockup Design

This is the next logical step after wireframing. It's when you design the basics of your layout and apply your design system + add assets such as images.

We will be aiming for medium resolution designs. You can and should create mobile versions for at least one of your pages, especially if you're attempting any challenging layouts to make sure that they render well. This will also help your development process by giving you a better visual of how your site content needs to flow.

### What is a mockup?

A mockup is a depiction of what something will more or less look like when finished. Generally you'll put a mockup onto a template of a screen to show it in context.

### Important Points

- Use the grid
- Apply a design system soon after starting
- Stick with your design system
- Group items logically (and don't be afraid to ungroup and change things)
- Make use of plugins to speed up your process
- Look to web pages that you would like to emulate, especially while learning

## Activity: Mockup a card design (30min)

- In a new figma file, create a desktop sized artboard
- Set up a 12 column grid layout
- Create a simple card design that would be able to be duplicated on the 12 column layout
  - follow [material design guidelines](https://material.io/components/cards)
  - **or** model it off of a card design from a website that you frequent

---

## Components

It's good to learn how components work by building your own first. However for fast production of mockups, you can use prebuilt component UI libraries. When you get to the development phase, this speed can be continued by using corresponding css frameworks.

### Activity: Turn your card into a component (15Min)

- Use the card you designed in our first Activity
- Turn it into a component
- Duplicate the component to make a 3 card pattern
- Change the information in the cards so that they are distinct

## Design Systems

A design system is very useful for creating mockups and prototypes quickly and consistently. A design system is a set of rules regarding visual elements such as: color, typography, spacing, border radius, and pseudo states.

A design system also include commonly used components such as buttons, cards, panels. Just like with the style assets, you can take a very structured approach to your components, or you can set up a minimal system. It depends on the scope of the project.

We are going to create a design system in Figma. These will be applied to both our mockups as well as our actual code. This is possible by using Figma plugins to export stylesheets based on our design systems.

### Important Plugins

- [StyleList](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/927255248672920500/StyleList-%E2%80%93-text-and-color-styles): Create text and color styles
- [Color Designer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739475857305927370/Color-Designer)]: Another color palette generator
- [Color Scheme](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/815841134222084922/Color-Scheme): Similar to StyleList for color generation
- [CSS Export](https://designcode.io/figma-handbook-exporting-css-codes): Export Vanilla CSS
- [Figma Tailwind](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/785619431629077634/Figma-Tailwindcss): Export a Tailwind Configuration
- [Tailwind Import](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/738806869514947558/Tailwind-CSS): Import a tailwind configuration file into Figma

## Design System Setup

- [Figma Design System Best Practices](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/components-styles-and-shared-libraries/)

1. Pick colors and generate variations
2. Pick typography and generate variations
3. Create a couple simple components to generate:
   - border-radius
   - effect styles

### Activity: Create a color scheme for your design system (15min)

- Use one of the above specified, or any other color palette generator
- Create a color palette that includes
  - a primary color
  - a secondary color
  - grayscale shades
- Set between 5 - 10 variations

### Activity: Create a Typography Scheme for your design system (15min)

- [Extra Reading: Typography](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/typography/)
- Choose 2 fonts
  - Heading
  - Body Text
- Set up all of your font variations
  - Label them based on html font names or based on utility class styles

### Debrief

- Show off your work
- Ask questions
- Learn from one another

## Prototyping

Protoyping adds functionality to your design. This includes navigation between pages, navigation on pages, animations and movement of elements

### Prototyping Basics

- In the left panel, select `Prototype`
- From here you'll be able to set prototype features onto your pages
- To create good prototypes, you'll be duplicating your frames to set before and after states for your various prototype features
- Be really happy with your mockup before you do too much prototyping (links get copied and this can get messy)
- clean up your design

#### Main steps in prototyping

- Group your frames based on the type of prototypes you're doing
- Set up your before and after states
- Make sure that you're on the prototype setting
- Link the state changes
- Set the interaction details
  - animation type
  - interaction
  - destination
  - time

#### Things to prototype

- top bar navigation
- mobile menu slide in
- hover states (buttons)
- image carosel
- anchor links

### Activity: Test out Prototyping (20min)

- Duplicate your mockup
- Change something on it (pick something that you would like to animate)
- Set up the animation to work as discussed

#### Debrief

- Show off your prototype's behaviour
