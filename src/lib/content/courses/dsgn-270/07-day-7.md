## Creating Mockups for Web Design

[![Mockups](images/slides/mockup-slide-image.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/dsgn-270/mockups.html)

### Mockup Design Asset Prep

- When you're ready to start a mockup, it is a good idea to establish your color palette and typography first.
- Create set colors and fonts and then expand your font sizes etc as needed
  - Using these will mean that when you make adjustments, you won't have to update in as many places

### Activity: Create a color scheme for your design system (15min)

- Use one of the above specified, or any other color palette generator
- Create a color palette that includes
  - a primary color
  - a secondary color
  - grayscale shades
- Set between 5 - 10 variations

### Activity: Create a Typography Scheme for your design system (15min)

- [Extra Reading: Typography](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/typography/)
- Choose 2 fonts
  - Heading
  - Body Text
- Set up all of your font variations
  - Label them based on html font names or based on utility class styles

## Components in Figma

- Create components that you can reuse to build your design quicker
  - Components should have generic content that you can change
  - Components should use colors and fonts from your design system
- [Figma Video Tutorials](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)
- Organize your components in a library, use folders and a **consistent** naming convention
  - [Organizing and Creating Libraries Docs](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/components-styles-and-shared-libraries/organizing-and-creating-libraries/)

### Activity: Make a button component (15min)

- Create a medium to high fidelity button
  - give it a name that like 'primary-button'
  - turn it into a component
- **Bonus** Set up a category for buttons in your component library
  - make a secondary button and store it in the category
