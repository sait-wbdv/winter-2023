## Design Principles

[![Design Principles Slides](/images/slides/design-principles.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/dsgn-270/visual-hierarchy)

### Activity: Design Review

- As a group of 3, pick a website to review
- Use Figma to take screenshots and add your main points on the 4 following topics to each image as the topics apply (ie: if there is no repetition being used, then don't address it **unless the design would be improved with it's usage**)
  1. Visual Hierarchy in general (how is some information made more important than others?)
  2. Reptition (How is it used?)
  3. Grid and Alignment (Is there a grid? or is it more fluid?)
  4. Typography (How are fonts giving character to the design? How are they affecting visual hierarchy?)

### Break 15 Min

## User Flows

- Initial Discussion Based on Homework Readings
  - What is our current understanding of users flows based on the readings?
- Watch [User Flow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIV1y11xz7k)

### Types of User Flows

- Establish an idea of who your users are and and what their goals are

1. Task Flows (the mental steps and tasks)
   - Steps that a user goes through to achieve their goal
2. Wireflows (lo-fi rendering of how the tasks are achieved)
   - Sketch screens that the user will go through
3. Screen flows (hi-fi)
   - mockup version that shows what the app will actually look like

## In Class Example

- Ash will walk through creating a user flow
- [Link to Figjam File](https://www.figma.com/file/JSuY5AkMcZZ3UfKI7ntpQS/User-Flow-Example?node-id=0%3A1)

### Break

## Activity: Create a Task Flow (30min)

- Using the same website as your review, Identify a user goal and build a task flow around it
- This should be done in the same file as your design review
