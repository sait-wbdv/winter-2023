## Visual Hierarchy

- Video: [Design Principles - Visual Hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWDJqY27bw) The Freelancers Journey
  - Put yourself in the shoes of your client's client
  - Overly complex and cluttered designs are hard to get information from
    - Avoid letting information compete for prominance
- Video: [Design Principles - Repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhhc5pzE9Y) - The Freelancers Journey
  - Use repeating patterns, sizes, and shapes to communicate meaning, set expectations, and create a pattern which can be **strategically broken**
- Video: [Design Principles: Grid Spacing and Alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QRIjnMEXw8)
  - Grids are commonly used in design to organize content
    - If content isn't balanced in sized, a traditional grid might not be the best way to organize content
- Video: [Design Principles - Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dESVj7-XzI)
  - Empty space is used to:
  1. create rhythm
  2. establish relationships between content
  3. give elements the ability to breathe
- Video [Design Principles - Typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yom0nogFN3k)
  - Display and Text typefaces
  - Typography makes a statement and creates identity

### Activity: Design Review

- In the same groups as the first activity, review your website's use of the following design pattners
  1. Visual Hierarchy in general (how is some information made more important than others?)
  2. Reptition (How is it used?)
  3. Grid and Alignment (Is there a grid? or is it more fluid?)
  4. Typography (How are fonts giving character to the design? How are they affecting visual hierarchy?)

### Debrief

- Each group discuss **1** aspect of design from your site

### Break 15 Min

## User Flows

- Initial Discussion Based on Homework Readings
  - What is our current understanding of users flows based on the readings?
- Watch [User Flow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIV1y11xz7k)

### Types of User Flows

- Establish an idea of who your users are and and what their goals are

1. Task Flows (the mental steps and tasks)
   - Steps that a user goes through to achieve their goal
2. Wireflows (lo-fi rendering of how the tasks are achieved)
   - Sketch screens that the user will go through
3. Screen flows (hi-fi)
   - mockup version that shows what the app will actually look like

## In Class Example

- Ash will walk through creating a user flow
- [Link to Figjam File](https://www.figma.com/file/JSuY5AkMcZZ3UfKI7ntpQS/User-Flow-Example?node-id=0%3A1)

### Break

## Activity: Create a Task Flow (30min)

- In same groups at the 1st 2 activities, you will create a user flow for 1-3 aspects of your site

1. Create a new figjam file for your group's user flow
2. Based on your use cases from the 1st activity, outline users and their potential goals
3. Each team member should be able to create a user flow based on an identified goal
4. Create a Task flow as demonstrated during the in class example
5. Pick a user flow to show to class

### Debrief

- Each team will walk through 1 user flow
