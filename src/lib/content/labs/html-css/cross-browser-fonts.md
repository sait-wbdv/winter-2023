### Activity: Cross-browser check
In groups of 3-4, with each group having both Mac and Windows browsers available:
1. Have each member load this list of [web-safe font stacks](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/eYNmYQP) in their browser;
2. Compare and contrast the differences of each stack between Mac and Windows PCs.
3. **Which font is active in your browser?** Find this by Inspecting the element. The active font is underlined in the `font-family` declaration.
