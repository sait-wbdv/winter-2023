## 3. Setting up `dailies`, `projects` and `assignments` directories
It's recommended that you set up the following directories in your workspace:
1. `dailies` for day-to-day code as one repo:
    ```
    /dailies
        /2022-09-19-box-model
            /topic-1
            /topic-2
        /2022-09-20
            /more-topics
    ```
2. `projects` for misc repos
    ```
    /projects
       /portfolio-site
       /moms-bakery
       /client-1
    ```
3. `assignments` for repos that contain WBDV assessments to be handed in:
    ```
    /cpnt-260
        /assignment-1
        /assignment-2
        /etc
    /cpnt-262
        /assignment-1
        /etc
    ```
