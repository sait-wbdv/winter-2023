In your groups, use RevealJS to build a slide deck about your project (don't worry, there's no presentation with this project).

**Popular configurations**:
- Set `hash` to `true` to be able to link to individual slides;
- Set `controls` to `false` to turn off arrows in bottom right corner;
    - Or set `controlsLayout` to move the controls to another part of the screen;
- Set `history` to `true` to add slide changes to browser history;
- Set `autoSlide` to `true` to auto advance slides;
- Set `transition` to pick a slide transition (options: `none`/`fade`/`slide`/`convex`/`concave`/`zoom`);
