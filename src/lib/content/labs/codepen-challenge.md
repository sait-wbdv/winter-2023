### 1. Demo: Codepen Challenge
**Instructions**
1. Copy and paste the code of [this empty HTML file](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6871979b4f4b04375edb6312dcdba5b7) into a file named `index.html`. Place this file inside it's own repo named `codepen-challenge`.
2. Move the code inside the Codepen HTML panel to a `<body>` element of an empty HTML page named `index.html`;
3. Move the code inside the CSS panel to a `<style>` element inside `<head>` element of the same HTML page;
4. Move the code inside the JS panel, if it exists, to a `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>` element of the HTML page;
5. Confirm the page is working as expected;
6. Push `index.html` to a GH repo named `codepen-challenge` and enable GH Pages;



## 2. Demo: Codepen export to GitHub Pages
If we can figure out how to easily publish a Codepen to GH Pages, you can submit Pens for Assignments 3 & 4.

### Instructions for exporting a Pen
1. Export Codepen as a ZIP;
2. Expand the ZIP;
3. Copy the following files to a new GH repo;
    - `/dist/index.html` -> `/index.html`
    - `/dist/style.css` -> `/css/style.css`
    - `/dist/script.js` -> `/js/script.js`, if applicable
4. Enable GH Pages;
