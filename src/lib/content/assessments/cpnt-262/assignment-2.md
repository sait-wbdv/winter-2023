## Marking Rubric
This assignment is worth 5 points for the following:

## Flowchart Presentation - 1 point
Your flowchart should:
- have a descriptive title;
- flow from left to right and from top to bottom;
- be a high enough quality that you would show it to a client.

## Symbol Usage - 4 points
All flowchart symbols and arrows should be used correctly:
**Start/End**
- Shape is a rounded rectangle;
- Start is required and should always be the same;
- Start always should be the first block;
- Flowchart may have no End or multiple Ends.

**Process**
- Shape is a rectangle;
- Involves a single action or verb in the flowchart.

**Input/Output**
- Shape is a parallelogram;
- Indicates a manual operation is needed.

**Decision**
- Shape is a rhombus or diamond;
- Outcome is a Yes or No;
- In general: Yes should go left-right and No should go down.

**Sub-process**
![Start-Stop symbol](../../assets/images/flowchart/sub-routine.png)
- Indicate an independent process with its own Start and End;
- In programs, this is often a separate function.

**Arrows**
- Indicate the flow of the chart;
- Are drawn from the output of one symbol to the input of another;
- Only one arrow can represent an output;
- Multiple arrows can represent inputs.
