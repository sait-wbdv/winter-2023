title: Assignment 1 - Before and After
type: assignment
points: 5
---

In this assignment, you will concatenate two "Before" strings, using template literals, to create one "After" string that is a complete sentence. 

You will also create two "Before" numbers and create four "After" numbers using different arithmetic operators.

## Instructions
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) the [starter repo](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/w23-262-a1-starter) for this assignment into your workspace;
2. Following the comments in `js/app.js`:
    1. Create two strings of your choice and assign each of them to the following variables:
        - `beforeString1`
            - i.e. "Tony"
        - `beforeString2`
            - i.e. "Grimes"
    2. Using [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), concatenate these two strings into a new, third, string and assign it to a variable named `afterString`;
        - The value of `afterString` should be a complete sentence. i.e. "Hi, my name is Tony Grimes."
    3. Repeat this process with numbers: create two numbers of your choice and assign them to the following variables:
        - `beforeNumber1`
            - i.e. 9.3
        - `beforeNumber2`
            - i.e. 5
    4. Using [arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math), create a four new numbers and assign them to variables named:
        - `afterNumber1`
        - `afterNumber2`
        - `afterNumber3`
        - `afterNumber4`
3. Add a comment above your "After" string and four "After" number declarations describing how/why you created them;
4. Log every variable you create to the console using `console.log()`.

## Marking Rubric
This assignment is worth 5 points for the following:
- **1 points**: Starter variables;
- **3 points**: After variables;
- **1 point**: Comments and `console.log()` statements.

The [starter repo](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/w23-262-a1-starter) will attempt to output the above variables to `index.html` and will produce syntax errors and/or undefined output until you successfully declare and assign all variables.

**Points will be deducted for**:
- Editing code in `index.html`,
- Editing `app.js` below the "Do not edit this code" comment,
- Syntax errors, 
- Logic errors,
- Outputting `undefined` to the page, and
- Not following the guidelines in [Javascript Basics](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html), starting at [Slide 9](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html#/9).
