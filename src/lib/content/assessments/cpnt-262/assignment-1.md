title: Assignment 1 - Before and After
type: assignment
points: 5
---

In this assignment, you will take two "Before" strings to create one "After" string. Then you'll do it again for numbers.

---

## Instructions
1. Fork and clone the [starter repo]() for this assignment into your workspace;
2. Following the comments in `js/app.js`:
    1. Create two strings of your choice and assign each of them to the following variables:
        - `beforeString1`
        - `beforeString2`
    2. Using template literals, concatenate these two strings into a new, third, string and assign it to a variable named `afterString`;
    3. Repeat this process with numbers: create two numbers of your choice and assign them to the following variables:
        - `beforeNumber1`
        - `beforeNumber2`
    4. Using arithmetic operators, create a third number and assign it to a variable named `afterNumber`;
3. Add a comment above your `afterString` and `afterNumber` declarations describing how/why you created them;
4. Log every variable you create to the console using `console.log()`.

## Marking Rubric
This assignment is worth 5 points for the following:
- **2 points**: Starter variables;
- **2 points**: After variables;
- **1 point**: Comments and `console.log()` statements.

The [starter repo]() will attempt to output the above variables to `index.html` and will produce syntax errors and/or undefined output until you successfully declare and assign all variables.

**Points will be deducted for**:
- Editing code in `index.html`,
- Editing `app.js` below the "Do not edit this code" comment,
- Syntax errors, 
- Logic errors,
- Outputting `undefined` to the page, and
- Not following the guidelines in [Javascript Basics](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html), starting at [Slide 9](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html#/9).
