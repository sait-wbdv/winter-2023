## Marking Rubric
Each of the following will be **worth 1 point** for a total of 5 points:

### 1. Function declaration
Your function should be defined with:
- a descriptive and appropriately formatted variable name;
- one or more parameters that allows it to perform its function.

### 2. Function operation
Your function should:
- incorporate other Javascript features covered in class (such as conditionals and/or built-in Javascript functions/methods);
- serve a practical purpose that can be used in real-life projects.

### 3. Function invocations
Your script should:
- invoke the function at least three times with different arguments;
- assign the returned results to appropriately named variables (that are located _outside_ the function);
- log each variable to the console.

### 4. Error handing
Using value validation and/or [default parameters](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-default-parameters/) (ES6) so that:
- no `undefined` results will be logged to the console;
- an error statement is returned when arguments are not passed to the invoked function OR [default parameter values](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-default-parameters/) are defined using ES6 syntax;
- an error statement is returned when unexpected arguments (such as if a string is passed when a number is expected) are passed to the invoked function.

### 5. Creativity and extended functionality
One point will be given for creating a function that:
- is distinct from examples presented in class;
- incorporates Javascript features and functionality not covered in class;
- allows user-generated input arguments when the page is refreshed by utilizing `window.prompt()`;
- _optionally_, you may output your result to `index.html` using the relevant code provided in Assignment 3.

- Logic errors,
- Not following the guidelines in [Javascript Basics](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html), starting at [Slide 9](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/js-introduction.html#/9).
