## Instructions

For this assignment, you will create two different types of wireframes; a user flow wireframe, and a layout wireframe. The user flow wireframe is intended to map out the actions that a user will do to engage with your website with a card sort method, and the layout wireframe will map out what the user flow will look like.

### Concept Details

It's recommended to design a layout that you will want to use for a final project; even if it's just a draft idea, wireframing is an excellent tool for testing an app/site concept without commiting too much time.

While it's recommended to use this to plan for your final project, it's not necessary and you are free to choose any topic that you want.

Your wireframes should be focused on how a user will achieve an outcome. Common outcomes are things like: Purchase a product, sign up for a service, access a service, learn about something...

Remember that the wireframing stage is about exploration, it's the process used to nail down a good UI, concept, expression of brand.

#### Concept Requirements

**These need to be described in long form text in a `README.md` file**

- A site topic with some sort of title
- A clearly defined user story (or stories if you are depicting alternative outcomes)

### Wireframe Details

Wireframes are low resolution designs, while they can be medium resolution, we are going to be going for low resolution wireframes. They should be quick to make and test.

#### Requirements

- Both types of wireframes need to be made in Figma
  - with both wireframes in the same Figma file but on 2 different pages (each file can have up to 3 pages on the free plan).
  - or using a workspace to group your content, with the UI wireframe in Figma, and the User Flow in Figjam.
- They need to relate to one another so that the UI reflects the user flow mapped in the cards.

## Content Requirements

- User Flow Wireframe:
  - uses a card sort type of map
  - maps out a primary goal for a user as well as 1-2 secondary goals
  - at least 1 set of options that track how a user would be able to leave after achiving a secondary or intermediary goal (viewing demo content, testing, using a minor feature - but not signing up for a full service is an example of this).
  - a minimum of 6 cards
- UI Wireframe:
  - layout for a full web page (at least 3 sections + the navbar and footer)
  - uses common design elements as learned previously in the course (hero sections, card layouts, lists, call to actions...)
  - low resolution design (no color, just boxes with content and interactive descriptions)
