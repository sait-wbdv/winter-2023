## Open Asset Hunt

For this activity, you will be gathering together assets to use for assignments. When working with a client, you will often need to acquire open licensed assets such as images, icons, and color pallettes for their website. 

**The goal of this activity is to gather content, and then organize it in an `assets/` folder in a git repo.**

### Instructions
Using the [Open-source Assets Cheatsheet](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/copyright/open-assets), and/or any other resources you can find online, collect the following openly licensed assets that centre around a topic of your choice:

1. Make a quick inspiration moodboard **10-20minutes**
  - Add a large title that describes the topic/theme in your own words (chaotic is ok here, this is for early planning)
  - Take screen caps of content that reflects the theme/topic/vibe that you're going for and add them to the moodboard (group however makes sense to you, add your own notes if it is helpful)
    - websites, fashion, interior design, landscapes, people, cartoons... _whatever captures the vibe for you_
  - **Do NOT add your actual asset content to this figjam file**
2. Create a git repo and add an `assets/` directory and a `README.md` file at the root level of the repo
    - **IMPORTANT** If you havea n assignment in mind for this, use that assignment repo and add the message **Open Asset Hunt Activity** to the git commit - (you'll use this link in your submission)
3. in your `assets/` directory, make sub-directories to organize all of your assets
    - for example:
        - `images/`
        - `icons/`
        - `logos/`
4. Find your assets!
    - this will be project dependent, a range of 4-12 items will work for just about any assignment
    - rename the file so that it has no spaces. use a consistent naming convention for all assets (ie: lowercase with hyphens or underscores)
    - add the attributionsto your readme as you go
5. In your `README.md` file, document the following:
    - course name and assignment title in a level 1 heading at the top of the pages
    - In regular text under the above heading, include your name as repo owner and maintainer (this should be a link to your github profile)
    - Below this, provide a brief outline (2-5 sentences) of the theme or topic of your content.
    - Also have a link to your concept moodboard
   - Make a level 2 heading called `Attributions` and under it, in an **unordered list** add attribution links to all of your assets
   - Attribution link format:
   ```
   - [Attribution filename](link-to-original) by [attribution creator](link-to-a-relevant-profile) licensed under [license type](link-to-license)
   ```

### Submission Details
- Submit a zipped folder with your repo to Brightspace
- In your submission, include a link to the actual project repo
