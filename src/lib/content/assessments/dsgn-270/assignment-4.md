type: assignment
points: 15

## Scenario

You have been hired to build a website and need to do a quick mockup of the homepage to provide a proof of concept to your client. The mockup will allow you to get feedback and make design changes prior to getting into any code.

When building mockups, you can save a lot on design and development time by creating a design system, however this is not necessary. You are free to utilize design systems from libraries, but must alter them to fit your design.

### Requirements

- Desktop mockup artboard should be either 1280px or 1920px wide
- Desktop mockup uses a 12 column grid
- Mobile wireframe artboard can use any of the phone presets in Figma
- Mobile wireframe uses a 4 or 5 column grid

### Notes

- As the client is hypothetical, this is a great opportunity to challenge your own ideas about design and website layouts. Try using a color pallette that you wouldn't normally choose or experiment with UI design patterns that you haven't worked with before - Remember it's much easier to be bold with design on a mockup than it is when you're at the development stage.
- For your design system, you can work off of one generated by a plugin, but it **must** be customized for your design, points will be deducted if stock colors and typefaces are submitted
- _you can be your own client_

## Instructions

1. (optional) Create a design system for your mockup (use a separate page in your design file)

   - Colors
   - Fonts
   - One other field (ie: shadow)

2. Create a mockup that makes use of UI components

   - Components should be created in the same page as your design system
   - UI elements that **must** be componentized:
     - elements that would be used on other web pages of the same site(header, footer, nav)
     - elements that are repeated on your landing page
     - **anything that would appear in about the same form on future pages**

3. Create a low res mobile wireframe of your mockup

   - Demonstrate how the design would resize onto a mobile device
   - This is a minimal design, placeholder text for long form text and shapes for images, but use the correct titles to make it easy to follow

4. Export your files and submit links
