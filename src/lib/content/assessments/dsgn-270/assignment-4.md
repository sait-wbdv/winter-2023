type: assignment
points: 20

## Scenario

You have been hired to build a website and need to do a quick mockup of the homepage to provide a proof of concept to your client. The mockup will allow you to get feedback and make design changes prior to getting into any code.

When building mockups, you can save a lot on design and development time by creating a design system, for this assignment, you will also be required to establish a basic design system (colors and fonts etc).

### Requirements

- Desktop mockup artboard should be either 1280px or 1920px wide
- Desktop mockup uses a 12 column grid
- Mobile wireframe artboard can use any of the phone presets in Figma
- Mobile wireframe uses a 4 or 5 column grid

### Notes

- As the client is hypothetical, this is a great opportunity to challenge your own ideas about design and website layouts. Try using a color pallette that you wouldn't normally choose or experiment with UI design patterns that you haven't worked with before - Remember it's much easier to be bold with design on a mockup than it is when you're at the development stage.
- For your design system, you can work off of one generated by a plugin, but it **must** be customized for your design, points will be deducted if stock colors and typefaces are submitted
- _you can be your own client_

## Instructions

1. Create a design system for your mockup (use a separate page in your design file)

- Colors
- Fonts
- One other field (ie: shadow)

2. Create a mockup that makes use of UI components

- Components should be created in the same page as your design system
- UI elements that **must** be componentized:
  - elements that would be used on other web pages of the same site(header, footer, nav)
  - elements that are repeated on your landing page

3. Create a low res mobile wireframe of your mockup

- Demonstrate how the design would resize onto a mobile device
- This is a minimal design, placeholder text for long form text and shapes for images, but use the correct titles to make it easy to follow

4. Export your files:

- Pngs or pdfs for your design files (desktop and mobile)
- Make sure the file naming conventions are appropriate for sending to a client (for the mockups) or using in a project (for the stylesheets)

## Marking Criteria

This assignment will be marked out of 20 points, which will be given for each of the following:

### Mockup Design: 5 points

- Use of a grid to organize content
- Effective visual hierarchy
- Good use of contrast and spacing
- 5 sections of content (header, footer, nav, and two others)
- Uses 1920 or 1280 px artboard

### Mockup Usability: 5pts

- Layout is easy to navigate and understand
- UI elements are consistent
- At least 1 call to action
- UI elements reflect good design convention (or challenge convention effectively and without sacrificing usability)

### Design System and Components: 5 points

- All colors and fonts are **applied** using the design sytem
- Design system and components are in a separate page in the same workspace
- Components are applied correctly (so that if you change the primary component, the applied component will reflect those changes)
- Exported stylesheet is usable
- Reusable elements have been converted into components

### Mobile Wireframe: 5 points

- All content from the desktop mockup is accounted for
- low resolution for content but approprately considers spacing and layout
- Realistically relates to the desktop variant
- Uses grid
- Uses one of the phone default screen sizes

   - The title of this assignment
   - Your name
   - A brief description of the client and what the website is for (2-5 sentences)
