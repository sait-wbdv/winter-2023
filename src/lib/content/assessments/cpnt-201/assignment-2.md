---

## Details
In this assignment, you will deploy three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for a fictitious business of your choice.

**Scenario**: You have landed a new client! They want to choose a template for their new website at the next meeting. You want to impress them with three websites that are:

- deployed (i.e. published) on GH Pages
- visually distinct with respect to UX/UI
- customized with the company name and logo
  - the name can be made up
  - the logo can be an icon from Font Awesome or similar source

## Instructions

1. Search online for three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for your selected client;
2. Deploy each template to GH Pages, naming each repo "cpnt201-a2-[template-name]";
3. Make at least three customizations to _each_ template **as separate commits**.
    - At the end of this assignment, you should have made at least 12 commits; three for each of the three customizations, plus your initial commits (which are not counted for marks).

## Marking Rubric
This assignment will be marked out of 20 points.

### GitHub Setup: 4 points
- Local name and email address set correctly in your config
- GitHub Profile updated with:
    - Profile photo
    - Bio
    - Location
    - Optional: website, Twitter, etc

### Distinctiveness: 4 points
The three templates will collectively be scored on their visual distinctiveness according to the criteria listed above. Each template should offer a diverse choice for the client by:
- being visually distinct from the other two templates;
- representing, collectively, a wide variety of layout elements (cards, sliders, gallery, etc).

### Each Template: 4 points (12 points total)
Each individual template will be marked according to the following criteria.
1. Functionality:
    - Each template should be responsive, and
    - have the potential to be a multi-page site.
2. Deployment:
    - Each template should be deployed using GitHub Pages (_not_ with a GH theme) and be viewable on a mobile device.
3. Committed Changes:
    - Your initial commit for each template should be the base template with no modifications. The commit message should be "Initial commit".
    - There should be at least three additional commits (in addition to commit 1, your initial commit) that customize content or code. For example:
        - page titles and headings (commit 2),
        - page logo/icon (commit 3),
        - primary navigation (commit 4).
    - Each change should have a descriptive commit message (i.e. NOT "updated page").
    - The changes themselves cannot break the design.

Please include a link to the original template source, either in the project README or as a comment to your Brightspace submission.
