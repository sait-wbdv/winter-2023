## Instructions

In a small team you will set up a new repository work together to merge code from feature branches into your main branch

Content wise this is an open assignment, it's the approach to merging, commenting, and working together that is top priority. However you will be expected to use a conventional web site file structure.

### 1. Repo Setup and PR Guidelines

- In your README.md add:
  - Team members (with links to github accounts)
  - Team Guidelines for merging Pull Requests (ie: # of reviewers required, commit message rules)
- Team members should all be added with maintainer access
- A heading under which each team member can link to their respective PR

### 2. Tasks

For simplicity sake, here are some tasks that can be used for PRs (these are not required but recommended tasks to break up into branches)
_Note that some of these must happen before others_

- Project Setup: directories with starter files (either manually with vanilla html/css/js or using svelte)
- Readme outline (writing out the Readme's layout, headings, and spaces for everyone to put their info into)
- Configure npm packages (add tailwind or other plugins and set them up)
- Add some page content

### 3. Code Reviews

- Every team member needs to make a review of a PR
  - This involved going through the commits and noting good things or issues in the code
