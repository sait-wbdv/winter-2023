## Content Topic and Quality
- All content must be either created by you or be openly-sourced;
- Content must fit with your chosen client profile.
- Ask your instructor if you'd like to change the minimums/maximums of a given Achievement.

## Submission instructions

- In the README of your Strapi project, include:
    - Course title
    - Assessment title

- As a comment in your submission, include an admin-level login for your instructor to mark your achievements:
