4205,Chelish Crux,moderate conjuration,9,none,"2,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A Chelish Crux is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest. A Chelish Crux appears to be a 6-inch-diameter wooden-and-metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12). Each of the crux's 12 surfaces is carved with a different shape or rune, and when an observer looks at the item, she has the unsettling sensation that too many sides can be seen at once. Shaking or rolling the box reveals that it is hollow, as objects within rattle and shift (though no amount of shaking can damage the objects within).  In order to open a Chelish Crux, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time one is traced in the correct order, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever one is  traced out of order, the runes flash brightly; this burns the person attempting to open the crux and causes all faces to deactivate, forcing the opening process to start anew. Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the box to randomly establish a new activation order.  A character can attempt a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box. Each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at this point, the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and deals 2 points of fire damage plus 2 points for each previous failure to the character (Reflex DC 15 half); the amount of damage resets to 2 if the activation order is reset.  A Chelish Crux can be forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength check or destroyed through physical damage (hardness 10, hp 30). If a crux is forced open in either of these ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, dealing 3d6+6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 half) to all creatures and objects within the burst, including any objects held within the crux. If forced open or destroyed, the crux crumbles to ashes, and any objects it contained fall to the ground at the site of the fiery burst.  When opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit on the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds up again as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners (a move action). The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically with 3 consecutive full-round actions.  A Chelish Crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish Crux functions as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining how long a living creature within can survive, or what happens when the box is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 501)","Craft Wondrous Item, fire trap, secret chest","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Chelish Crux</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>Aura </b>moderate conjuration; <b>CL </b>9th</h5><h5><b>Slot </b>none; <b>Price </b>2,000 gp; <b>Weight </b>5 lbs.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>A <i>Chelish Crux</i> is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest.

526,Ioun Stone sepia ellipsoid,strong abjuration,18,none,"68,000 gp",,"This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way.

More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below. • Darkvision to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the world through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest power, though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD. The oculus of Abaddon is powerfully neutral evil and possesses a limited and hateful intellect of its own.

671,Necklace of Lovelies,abjuration (evil),17,neck,"36,000gp",4 lbs.,"This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but miniaturized pixie. While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities. As a swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of the pixies on the necklace-doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the necklace becomes nonmagical. The magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes and returns to normal size-in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon). An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled-it allows the lucky soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept.","Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment, shield other, 6 willing or helpless pixies","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Necklace of Lovelies</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>Aura </b>abjuration (evil); <b>CL </b>17th</h5><h5><b>Slot </b>neck; <b>Price </b>36,000gp; <b>Weight </b>4 lbs.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but miniaturized pixie.

Within the vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex of air.  To capture a haunt's energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)-this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt.  If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green-if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes.  A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit.

905,"Spirit Planchette, Brass",moderate divination,9,none,"4,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist-brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this ""board"" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""maybe,"" or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received.

Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature.

If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects.

To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out.

The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim.

It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.  Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.  Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again.  • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will.  • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability.  • Invisibility purge at will.  • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.",,"<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Suishen, Guardian of the Amatatsu (Minor Artifact)</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>Aura </b>strong evocation; <b>CL </b>20th</h5><h5><b>Slot </b>none; <b>Weight </b>6 lbs.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>STATISTICS</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>AL </b>NG; <b>Ego </b>25</h5><h5><b>Int </b>12, <b>Wis </b>16, <b>Cha </b>13</h5><h5><b>Senses </b>60 ft., darkvision, detect Amatatsu scions, read languages</h5><h5><b>Communication </b>speech, telepathy</h5><h5><b>Languages </b>Common, Tien</h5><h5><b>Powers </b>Constant-endure elements  3/day-air walk, daylight, resist energy (cold), see invisibility</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p><i>Suishen</i> is a <i>+2 defending flaming katana</i> (see page 27).

The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material.  All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil.  Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to ""speak"" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may ""read"" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating.  A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits.  The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures.  The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39).

The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck.  The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner.  The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner.  When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save.

Shallow gouges on one side of the block serve as a bed in which up to 20 tiny clusters of cubic minerals blossom and grow. Plucking a cluster is a standard action, and plucked clusters regrow on the relic in 1 month. Plucked clusters have no powers of their own, but inserting a cluster into one of the six holes in the cubic spiral as a standard action activates one of the artifact's functions. Once a user activates a function of the cubic spiral, the function remains active until complete (if a limitation is specified below), until the user commands the artifact to cease its function, or until the user is no longer within 1,000 feet. Except for the diminution function, the cubic spiral can engage in only one function at a time.  Diminution (front facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral shrinks to any size between its full size and 1 foot in height, as commanded. The weight of the artifact decreases proportionally with its height; at its smallest size, it weighs 150 pounds.  Drill (front facing, middle hole): This function activates only if the cubic spiral is at its smallest size. The cubic spiral spins and pushes its way relentlessly in an indicated direction, boring an 18-inch-diameter hole into solid objects at a rate of 10 feet per round. The cubic spiral can bore through any material with a hardness of less than 20. Creatures can move easily out of the way of the spinning artifact, but those that don't take 20d6 points of slashing damage (no save). The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. Once it has reached this distance, or if it cannot proceed to the full distance, the cubic spiral returns to the user through the borehole.  Slide (front facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral slides rapidly in an indicated direction at a speed of 100 feet per round. This movement need not be along the ground, as the artifact can slide through the air or across water. The cubic spiral deals 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path (Reflex DC 20 negates). If it's not at its full size, reduce the damage dealt by 1d6 for each foot smaller than its full size. The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. The cubic spiral's slide stops at the end of this distance or if it encounters a wall or other impassable object. If airborne at the end of its slide, it falls but takes no damage regardless of the distance fallen.  Temperature Regulation (rear facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral radiates waves of heat or cold to adjust the temperature within 1,000 feet. The user indicates a temperature between -20° F and 140° F, and the artifact maintains that temperature within the area.  Tornado (rear facing, middle hole): The cubic spiral spins quickly in place, creating an effect like a stationary tornado (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) within 100 feet and creating severe winds within 1,000 feet.  Vacuum (rear facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral destroys all air adjacent to it each round. Creatures adjacent to the artifact can't speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else that requires breathing.

It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability.

The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape.  Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called.

At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.  • Dancing lights (once per hour)  • Light (twice per night)  • Ball lightning (special, once per night)  • Shooting stars (special, three per week)  The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice).

Multiple balls can be released in the same round.  The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time.

1493,Rod Of Lordly Might,strong varies,19,none,"70,000 gp",10 lbs.,"This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.  The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.  • Use hold person upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.  • Use Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.  • Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.  The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.  • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon stretches to an overall length of 4 feet.  • When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth from the ball, and the whole weapon lengthens to 4 feet.  • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or a +3 longspear. A spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice) for an overall length ranging from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.  The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5.  • The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.  • When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, bull's strength, fear, flame blade, hold person, inflict light wounds","<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Rod Of Lordly Might</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5><b>Aura </b>strong varies; <b>CL </b>19th</h5><h5><b>Slot </b>none; <b>Price </b>70,000 gp; <b>Weight </b>10 lbs.</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.

She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.   A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.   A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.
